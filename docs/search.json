    "text": "Autoregressive Large Language Model\n“An autoregressive large language model (AR-LLM) is a type of neural network model that can generate natural language text. It has a very large number of parameters (billions or trillions) that are trained on a huge amount of text data from various sources. The main goal of an AR-LLM is to predict the next word or token based on the previous words or tokens in the input text. For example, if the input text is”The sky is”, the AR-LLM might predict “blue” as the next word. AR-LLMs can also generate text from scratch by sampling words from a probability distribution. For example, if the input text is empty, the AR-LLM might generate “Once upon a time, there was a princess who lived in a castle.” as the output text.”1\nBing Chat, Accessed: 09-05-23 https://sl.bing.net/vDC45Llquq"

    "text": "AR-LLMs can simulate “Turing Machines”\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: We show that transformer-based large language models are computationally universal when augmented with an external memory. Any deterministic language model that conditions on strings of bounded length is equivalent to a finite automaton, hence computationally limited. However, augmenting such models with a read-write memory creates the possibility of processing arbitrarily large inputs and, potentially, simulating any algorithm. We establish that an existing large language model, Flan-U-PaLM 540B, can be combined with an associative read-write memory to exactly simulate the execution of a universal Turing machine, \\(U_{15,2}\\). A key aspect of the finding is that it does not require any modification of the language model weights. Instead, the construction relies solely on designing a form of stored instruction computer that can subsequently be programmed with a specific set of prompts.\n\n\nSchuurmans, Dale. “Memory Augmented Large Language Models Are Computationally Universal.”\narXiv, January 9, 2023. https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.04589."

    "text": "What is Trusted AI – Let’s ask ChatGPT!\nTrusted AI encompasses systems that are not only ethically aligned but also reliable, robust, secure, transparent, and accountable. While ethical considerations form a crucial aspect, Trusted AI extends to include the technical quality and performance of the system. The goal is to create AI technologies that various stakeholders—including users, developers, businesses, and regulators—can trust to behave as intended and to meet specific performance, security, and governance standards.\nThe concept integrates aspects from multiple domains, such as:\n\nEthics: Fairness, transparency, and accountability.\nReliability: Consistent and dependable system performance.\nRobustness: Ability to handle unexpected inputs or conditions without failing.\nSecurity: Measures to protect data and models from unauthorized access and tampering.\nTransparency: Understandability of system decisions and actions.\nAccountability: Mechanisms to trace actions back to the responsible entities for evaluation and auditing.\n\nIn this broader context, “trust” is a multidimensional construct. It’s not just about being ethical but about fulfilling a wide range of expectations and standards that make a system worthy of trust."

    "text": "What is Trusted AI – Let’s ask Claude 2!\nTrusted AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that are designed and validated to be reliable, safe and technically robust. Key principles of trusted AI include:\n\nReliability - AI systems consistently produce accurate, reproducible results that can be externally validated. Models are unbiased and decisions explainable.\nSafety and security - AI systems are developed using secure software practices and are resilient against attacks, hacking or misuse. They protect privacy and confidentiality.\nExternal oversight - There are independent audits and ongoing monitoring of AI systems to ensure transparency and identify issues. Public disclosure builds trust.\nHuman control - Humans remain fully in control of AI systems, which augment human intelligence rather than replace it. Autonomous systems have human supervision.\nProportionality - AI capabilities do not exceed what is appropriate for the task. AI is not used when less advanced technology suffices.\nTechnical robustness - AI systems are thoroughly tested for stability, scalability and corner cases. Failsafes prevent glitches or unintended harm.\n\nIn contrast to responsible AI, trusted AI emphasizes technical system properties over organizational processes. It focuses on engineering reliable, safe and externally validated AI, rather than holistic internal governance."

You’re not just listening to the words, but also noticing who’s talking to whom, the tone, the context, and you’re making judgments about what’s important or not. That’s kinda what the Transformer architecture does, but for sequences of data like sentences or time-series data.\nAt the core, a Transformer has two main parts: the Encoder and the Decoder. Each has multiple identical layers stacked on top of each other.\n\nEncoder: Takes in the sequence (like a sentence “Hello, how are you?”) and processes it as a whole. It outputs a sort of “summary” or “context” for each word in the sequence.\n\nSelf-Attention: Each word checks out all the other words and figures out which ones are important to it. The magic formula called attention scores helps in this.\nFeed-forward neural networks: After attention, each word passes through a mini neural network that’s the same for all words, transforming it yet again."

It does this not once, but multiple times, diving deeper and deeper into the context each time.\nIt’s like a super-efficient assembly line for sequences, enabling models like me to generate text or translate languages at scale. And this architecture has been the basis for a lot of breakthroughs in natural language processing. It’s versatile, parallelizable, and mighty powerful!"

One plays both classical and jazz seamlessly (encoder-decoder), another specializes only in classical (encoder), and the last one is all about that jazz (decoder).\n\nEncoder-Decoder Networks: These are like your all-rounder orchestras. In the machine learning world, these models are often used for tasks like machine translation. The encoder part processes the input language, let’s say, English, and the decoder part spits out the output in another language, maybe Spanish. They work together like a well-conducted orchestra, each contributing to the final masterpiece.\nEncoder-Only Networks: Imagine an orchestra that’s focused entirely on classical music, where each musician feeds into the other to create a beautiful symphony. In tech, these models are good for tasks like text classification or sentiment analysis. The encoder processes the text and summarizes it in a way that lets you say, “Ah, this review is positive!”"

GPT models, like the one you’re talking to, belong to this category. The decoder starts with a seed (your prompt) and keeps generating one word at a time, predicting the next best word until it forms a coherent reply. It doesn’t need to look back at an original input sentence like in translation; it just jams out text based on what it has learned during its training.\n\nSo, you’ve got different setups for different gigs. If you need a two-way conversation between languages, you go for the encoder-decoder. If you want to understand the essence of a piece of text, you’d lean on the encoder. And if you want to generate text, like writing or even code, the decoder is your go-to musician. Each has its own style, its own instruments, and its own unique approach to making beautiful “music”—or in our case, useful computations."

Alright, think of the Transformer architecture as a fancy new instrument—a versatile electric guitar, let’s say, that can produce a whole range of sounds from classical to rock to jazz. Now, just like you can use that electric guitar in different types of bands, you can use parts of the Transformer architecture in different types of models.\n\nEncoder-Decoder Networks with Transformers: When people initially talked about Transformers, they were often referring to the full shebang—both encoder and decoder. In a language translation model, the Transformer’s encoder reads an English sentence and compresses its essence. The decoder then takes this essence and generates a Spanish sentence. Both sides are using self-attention, layer normalization, and all those Transformer goodies to do their jobs.\nEncoder-Only Transformers: In some tasks, you don’t need the full band; a guitar solo will do. For instance, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses just the encoder part of the Transformer architecture. It processes a sentence and spits out a rich, contextual representation of each word, which can then be used for tasks like text classification or filling in blanks.\nDecoder-Only Transformers: Now, what if we only want to jam and improvise? That’s where models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) come in. These models use only the decoder part of the Transformer architecture to generate new text. They still use self-attention and feed-forward layers, but they are more about predicting the next note—or in our case, the next word—in a sequence."

    "text": "Our Toolset\nAI Success Factors: Engineering Trust in Deployments is more than just a blog - it’s a demonstration of how modern data science tools can streamline and simplify complex processes.\nOur blogging platform is built using Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system known for its flexibility and robustness. Quarto has the unique ability to support a wide range of content types, including Jupyter notebooks, R Markdown, and even Python or R scripts. Quarto’s distinctive feature is its ability to include executable code within the documents from various languages such as Python, R, and others. This allows us to create data-driven blog posts where the output - be it a graph, a table, or other data representations - is generated directly from the included code. This adds an interactive element to our posts, giving readers a deeper understanding of the concepts and analyses presented. Quarto supports multiple output formats including HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Word, providing us the versatility to tailor our content to suit different needs. This flexible tool, coupled with its capability to handle larger projects made up of multiple files, allows us to efficiently manage our blog while maintaining consistency and quality across our posts. Quarto presentations are also used to generate revealjs presentations for weekly slide shows. Quarto forms the basis for Fast.ai’s nbdev framework for exploritory programming allowing for software development in Jupyter Notebooks and automated generation of Python modules and documentation from the notebooks.\nDevelopment Containers serve as our primary environment for data science, providing a consistent and replicable framework for running our analyses. These containerized environments allow us to standardize our work and ensure that our research is reproducible and reliable. The dev container uses the Mamba solver to provision the python environment from the specification in the environment.yml.\nWe use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as our primary code editor, taking advantage of its rich ecosystem of extensions and in-built features. VS Code’s Jupyter notebook support allows us to interactively develop and visualize our data models directly within the editor, enabling us to produce intuitive, data-driven narratives for our blog posts.\nAll of our content is version controlled and hosted on GitHub. GitHub’s robust versioning system allows us to effectively manage changes, track progress, and ensure that every piece of content we publish is up to date and accurate.\nThe blog is published using GitHub Page, a platform that simplifies the deployment process and seamlessly integrates with our existing GitHub repository. This setup enables us to provide a reliable, accessible resource for our readers, irrespective of where they are or when they choose to access our content.\nFinally, we utilize GitHub Code Spaces to create a fully-featured, cloud-hosted development environment that can be accessed from any device. This not only allows us to work from anywhere but also ensures that our setup can be easily replicated by other researchers and developers who wish to explore our code.\nEach tool in our stack has been chosen for its ability to facilitate efficient, reliable, and transparent data science. By sharing our toolset, we hope to provide insight into our workflows and encourage a culture of open, reproducible research within the AI community."

    "text": "Generative AI in Content Creation\nIn creating AI Success Factors: Engineering Trust in Deployments, we harness the power of artificial intelligence in conjunction with human expertise. We utilize advanced Generative AI models such as ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Anthropic Claude in a guided, iterative process that combines the best of AI and human capabilities.\nOur use of Generative AI begins with the drafting stage. These models, trained on extensive datasets, generate human-like text that matches our specified tone and style, providing us with a solid foundation for each blog post. This allows us to focus on the larger narrative without getting mired in the nitty-gritty details from the outset.\nThe AI-generated drafts, while sophisticated, are just the starting point. We employ a methodology that involves guiding the AI to improve its output. This includes providing more detailed prompts, specifying the format we want the output in, or asking the model to think step-by-step before settling on a conclusion.\nOnce we have a draft that we’re satisfied with, it’s time for human intervention. Our team reviews the AI-generated content, refining and editing it to ensure it maintains the standards of accuracy, relevance, and depth that our readers expect. This process leverages critical human skills of creativity, critical thinking, and domain expertise that even the most advanced AI can’t replicate.\nThis approach exemplifies our vision of a symbiotic relationship between AI and humans. By effectively integrating Generative AI into our content creation process, we not only boost our productivity and efficiency but also demonstrate the practical application of AI technologies in real-world scenarios. Thus, the blog becomes a testament to our commitment to translational research and our pursuit of an AI-integrated future."
