## Introduction and Context of Trusted AI (TAI)

In an age where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an unprecedented pace, trust in these intelligent systems is paramount—especially within the context of military operations. Welcome to a reflection on the Trusted AI (TAI) Frameworks Project, a [collaborative initiative](https://www.wbiw.com/2021/06/30/nswc-crane-iu-notre-dame-and-purdue-team-up-to-provide-trusted-ai-workforce-development-and-research/?_ga=2.194216941.1383268119.1691608623-1280995064.1690554908) between Indiana University, University of Notre Dame, and CRANE Naval Surface Warfare Center as part of [Scalable Asymmetric Lifecycle Engagement (SCALE)](https://research.purdue.edu/scale/about/index.php) led by Purdue University. Our mission is to enhance the successful and trusted deployment of AI to the Navy and Marine Corps and fortify the trust that humans have when interacting with these systems.

The TAI Frameworks Project started modestly, aiming to provide a potential integration point for outputs from other TAI projects. It sought to inform the Navy in deployment decisions but has since grown and evolved. At the core of this endeavor are the six dimensions of trust in AI:

- **Explainability:** Making the logic and reasoning behind AI decisions transparent.
- **Safety and Robustness:** Ensuring that AI operates reliably under different conditions.
- **Non-discrimination and Fairness:** Guaranteeing that AI does not favor or prejudice against particular groups.
- **Privacy:** Protecting individual's information and rights.
- **Environmental Sustainability:** Recognizing the ecological footprint of AI systems.
- **Accountability and Audibility:** Holding AI and its developers responsible for decisions and actions.

Each of these dimensions resonates with different stages of the AI lifecycle, including Data Collection, Data Preparation, Feature Extraction, Training, Testing, and Inference, and is aligned with the AI CI/CD of Development, Use, Analysis, and Re-Design.

**Reflection on the Framework Project**

As we look back on the past years, we see an ever-evolving project that has adapted to the rapidly evolving landscape of **Artificial Intelligence** research and products. The integration of trust dimensions into our framework's components, tools, and methodologies has shaped a solution aligned with the Navy's mission. Furthermore, we have explored broader themes like ethical considerations, workforce development, and community involvement, highlighting the multifaceted nature of our approach to trusted AI. This is end of my first year as PI of the project after taking over from [Prof. Jarek Nabrzyski](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=jaroslaw-nabrzyski) who helmed the first year of the project with [Prof. Chris Sweet](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=christopher-sweet) and [myself](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=charles-vardeman). The project was originally proposed by [Prof. Ian Taylor](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=ian-taylor), who went on leave from the [CRC](https://crc.nd.edu/) as the project was beginning that led to [Prof. Jarek Nabrzyski](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=jaroslaw-nabrzyski) to step in and provide leadership as PI. The direction of the project has changed since the acceptance of the initial proposal as a funded project, but many of the ideas and components of the proposal have remained. Work on evaluating and understanding the challanges and potential solutions to deploying AI technologies in the Navy, as well as capturing and understanding academic AI research outputs fell to Research Programmer [Dr. James Sweet](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=james-sweet) who spent time reviewing and understanding solutions that were being developed as [open source](https://opensource.org/licenses/) projects and applied in industry to solve some of the challanges with "*AIOps*." Additionally we had some help in creating some simple examples for using the Frameworks and starting the process of thinking about **metadata** for Trusted AI from [Prof. Don Brower](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=don-brower) who came to the CRC last year from the [Notre Dame Hesburgh Libraries](https://www.library.nd.edu/). In year 2. we were joined by [Prof. Paul Brenner](https://crc.nd.edu/about/people/?id=paul-brenner), who has vast expeience with compute infrastructure and engineering in the military context. We were also joined by several [UND](https://www.nd.edu) undergraduate students **Peter Ainsworth**, **Nicholas Clark** and **Daniel Weldon** who created documentation, tutorials and "*kicked the tires*" on some of the Framework components in as part of the "*AI Application*" development process. We also had three students, **Daniel Weldon**, **William Shephard**, **Samantha Nagel** looking at existing cloud platforms and infrastructure in use by the DoD and attempting to [*containerize*](https://www.ibm.com/topics/containerization) AI applications based on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) to understand the complexity and barriers to AI applications in the DoD cloud.

**Looking Ahead and Future Vision**

As we move forward, our commitment to continuous alignment with trust dimensions and evolving methodologies remains steadfast. Our reflection on achievements and lessons learned will be a guiding light, illuminating the path towards future developments in trusted AI.


## Building a Foundation for Trusted AI

### Software 1.0 vs Software 2.0: Building Trust from the Ground Up

The evolution from "Software 1.0" to "Software 2.0," as popularized by Andrej Karpathy [@karpathy2017software], represents a paradigm shift in how we develop and deploy software systems.

- **Software 1.0** is characterized by deterministic, programmed behavior where engineers write explicit code to define how a system should operate. It's a method where rules are meticulously crafted, and the outcome is predictable, given a specific set of inputs.

- **Software 2.0**, in contrast, signifies learned behavior where models are trained on data to infer the underlying patterns. Unlike the rigid rules of Software 1.0, Software 2.0 can handle immense complexity, learning from examples to generalize and adapt to new situations. This ability to process and respond to intricate, multi-dimensional inputs sets Software 2.0 apart, opening doors to applications previously thought unfeasible.

The implications of Software 2.0 are profound for sectors that face **highly complex and dynamic environments**, such as those present in Navy operations. Where traditional rule-based systems may falter or become unwieldy, Software 2.0 offers the flexibility and adaptability to respond to ever-changing scenarios. Its capacity to absorb and interpret vast amounts of information in real-time provides a powerful tool in navigation, threat assessment, strategy formulation, and more. For the Navy, it enables a more resilient, intelligent, and agile approach to both strategic planning and operational execution.

However, the promise of Software 2.0 doesn't diminish the importance of Trusted "Software 1.0" as the foundation. Stability, predictability, and reliability remain essential, and the Trusted AI Frameworks Project recognizes the symbiotic relationship between these two paradigms. Trusted "Software 1.0" forms the stable base, while Trusted "Software 2.0" enables more dynamic and complex solutions.

In traditional AI development, much attention is often given to fine-tuning model architectures, experimenting with different layers, activation functions, and optimization algorithms. While this approach has driven many innovations, it may sometimes overlook the central role of data in AI success.

A paradigm shift is emerging, championed by AI leaders like Andrew Ng through the [**Data Centric AI**](https://datacentricai.org/) movement. This movement emphasizes the need to invest more in the quality and context of the data rather than continually fine-tuning the model architecture. The MIT [Introduction to Data-Centric AI](https://dcai.csail.mit.edu/) course provides a very good introduction to Data Centric AI methodology that the Frameworks aim to enable.

The logic behind this shift is profound yet straightforward. Models, irrespective of their complexity, are only as good as the data they learn from. By prioritizing data quality, encompassing aspects such as cleanliness, relevance, diversity, and contextual richness, AI systems can achieve better performance with potentially simpler architectures.

This data-centric approach aligns well with the requirements of organizations like the Navy and Marine Corps. In complex environments where variability and uncertainty are common, the depth and quality of data can make a significant difference. A well-annotated dataset that captures the intricacies of real-world scenarios allows AI models to learn more effectively and generalize better to unseen situations.

For the Trusted AI (TAI) Frameworks Project, a data-centric philosophy serves as an essential cornerstone, recognizing that robust data management practices can lead to more reliable, interpretable, and trusted AI systems. This perspective does not diminish the value of innovative modeling but places it in the context of a balanced and well-considered AI development strategy, where data and model work in harmony.

The data-centric approach is not just a technical reorientation; it's a recalibration of AI development's very essence, placing data at the heart of the innovation process. The implications for trusted AI are profound, offering a path to AI systems that are not only highly capable but also aligned with the nuanced requirements and ethical considerations that define the evolving landscape of AI in military and civil applications.
